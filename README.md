To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

1. A web browser to see the website.

2. And a code editor if you want to edit the code. For example, Vs Code.

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

1. Clone it using your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Alejandroq12/blackjack-js.git
```

2. If the previous method does not work you may also download the repo as a .zip file and once you decompress the .zip file you are ready to use it.

### Install

Install this project with:

1. To see this project you will not need to install something else.

2. But in case you want to test the linter that I configured to check errors you will have to complete the following steps:

Run the command to install all necessary dependencies (including linters):

```
npm install

```

3. If you run npm install do not forget to create a .gitignore file to prevent the node_modules to be uploaded to GitHub:

```
.gitignore
node_modules/
```

### Usage

To see this project you will only need to:

1. Open the index.html file with a web browser.

### Run tests

1. Make sure all the linters and their configurations are installed and set up correctly in your project. If you haven't installed them yet, run `npm install` in your project directory to install the packages listed in your `package.json` file.

2. Run each linter with the following commands:

- For ESLint:
```
npx eslint .

```
- For Stylelint:
```
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"

```
- For hint:
```
npx hint .

```
3. Review the output of each linter and fix any issues reported.

### Deployment

You can deploy this project using GitHub pages:

1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository that contains your website files.
2. Make sure that your website files are located in the main branch and in the root directory of the repository.
3. If your website is not already live, make sure that the index.html file is the main page of your website.
4. Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.
5. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
6. In the "Source" dropdown menu, select the branch where your website files are located. For a simple website with only HTML and CSS, this is typically the main branch.
7. In the "Path" field, make sure that the root directory is specified (i.e., "/").
8. Click "Save" to generate your website.
9. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build and deploy your website.
10. Once the website is deployed, visit the GitHub Pages URL to view your site.
